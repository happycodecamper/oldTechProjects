                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1822</strong> - Born on December 27th in the town of Dole, France to a family of a poor tanner.</li>

                        <li><strong>1827</strong> - Family moved to Arbois, France.</li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>1829</strong> - Student at École Primaire, Arbois. His teachers considered him an average student
                            with a passion for drawing and painting with a keen eye for detail and precision.
                            His teachers encouraged him to follow his artistic skills, but his father considered
                            painting an indulgence.
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>1840</strong> - Student at Collège Royal de Besançon, France: Bachelor of Arts degree.</li>

                        <li><strong>1842</strong> - Student at Collège Royal de Besançon, France: he earned Bachelor of Science degree.</li>

                        <li><strong>1847</strong> - Student at École Normale Supérieure (Paris): he earned his Doctorate degree.</li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>1848</strong> - Began his career as a professor of chemistry at the University of Strasbourg,
                            France and became Chair of Chemistry in the faculty of sciences
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>1849</strong> - Married Marie Laurent, the daughter of the university's rector, and had five children,
                            though only two survived childhood. While attempting to solve a problem concerning the
                            nature of tartaric acid found in the wine fermentation, his observations led to a new field
                            called stereochemistry.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>1854</strong> - Appointed dean of the science faculty at the University of Lille where he worked on research
                            to find solutions for the manufacturers of alcoholic drinks and found out that organisms such
                            as bacteria were responsible for souring wine, beer and even milk.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>1857</strong> - He moved to Paris where he became the director of scientific studies at the École Normale
                            Supérieure, working from 1858 to 1867, and introduced several procedures to improve the standard
                            of scientific work. During that time, he developed ideas that the alcoholic fermentation was due
                            to yeast of beer, found everywhere that sugar is decomposed.
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>1859</strong> - Pasteur lost his daughter to typhoid – a disease caused by dirty food and water.</li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>1862</strong> - Completed on April 20th, the first test of a process to remove bacteria from milk by heating it to
                            a temperature of 60 -100 Celsius Degrees and then cooling it. The process is known as pasteurization.
                            He disproved the theory of spontaneous generation:
                            <em>
                                “There is no known circumstance in which it can be
                                confirmed that microscopic beings came into the world without germs, without parents similar to themselves”.
                            </em>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>1863</strong> - French vineyards were losing money when wine bottles spoiled in transit. Pasteur realized that this
                            was due to contamination, but boiling wine to kill bacteria made it taste terrible. In a series of
                            careful experiments, Pasteur discovered that heating wine to 55 Celsius Degrees killed bacteria without
                            ruining the its taste.
                        </li>

                            by parasites, and showed how infected silkworms could be isolated and destroyed. At this time, Pasteur
                            lost his second daughter who died due to typhoid as well.

                            cure for rabies – a very common disease at the time using similar principles he developed a weakened
