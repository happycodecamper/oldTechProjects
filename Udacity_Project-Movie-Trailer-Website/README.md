# Project Movie Trailer Website
 This is a Nanodegree Udacity Project which is part of my Full Stack Web Developer course.
 
 The main objective of this project is to create a website which displays some of my favorite movie trailers.

## Installation
1. **Install Python**
	Note: Python version might start with the number 2 or 3. These are different major versions of Python and have some significant differences. Most of the Full Stack Nanodegree program is built with Python 2.x in mind.
	Click [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download Python. 
 
2. Clone the GitHub repository and make sure that all files below belong to the same folder. Here are the files you will need:
    1. my_Media.py
    2. my_Entertainment_Center.py
    3. fresh_tomatoes.py
    
3. Once you have installed Python and all three files, open my_Entertainment_Center.py using Python Shell, and run the program. It will open a new webbrowser tab showing my favorites movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.

4. You may click on any of the box art URL which will open a window showing the trailer of that specific movie. 

#### Notes about the project files:

1. **my_Media.py**: it provides a class named Movie which stores movie related information;
2. **my_Entertainment_Center.py**: it contains a list of movie objects. This file calls the constructor my_Media.Movie() to instantiate movie objects;
3. **fresh_tomatoes.py**: it has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is the list of movies, and creates an HTML file which will display all of my favorite movies.
